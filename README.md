  ## Description
  A README.md generator for developers desiring to produce their README.md file in less time with greater efficiency. Utilizing node_modules' Inquirer Package, the user will invoke this command-line based application to create professional README file that includes a Table of Contents with clickable links to redirect you to its corresponding section in your README page. Within these series of questions, the user will have the option to select their licence and will then be provided with the license's badge and link to its description. 

  ## Installation
  1. Clone my respository by inputting the following in your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/Git-BritHub/README-Quickly.git`
  2. When cloning is complete, input `cd README-Quickly` and open the repo.
  3. Next, install the needed package dependencies by running `npm i`

  ## Usage
  1. To invoke the application, input `node index.js` in your terminal after you have finished the [Installation](#installation) steps given above.
  2. Answer the command-line questions and select your needed repo license from a list of most commonly used licenses. Once selected, and all command-line questions answered, your README.md will now include your selected license badge and a link to its license description. 
  3. If you do not wish to put any content in one of the sections that is asked about in the command-line, simply press enter to skip and the section title will still be autopopulated in your README.md for you to fill out at a later time. 
  4. When being asked what you would like to put in certain sections, if there is a section that you do not need or want, press enter to skip and make sure to delete the automated section that is created in your new README.md file, along with its corresponding section title in the Table of Contents. 
  5. Once your new README.md file has been created, feel free to edit and add extra information or formatting necessary. Also feel free to change your license badge's color by simply deleting the color text that is already in its link and then replacing it with your desired color's name.
  6. Feel free to watch this [Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ob2Oa8tCl4azdXnCM8cSs12apJhPwJGy/view) that includes a walkthrough of README-Quickly's command-line process.
